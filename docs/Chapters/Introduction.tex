\section{Introduction}

Othello is a board game for two players, \textit{white} and \textit{black}.
In turns they can place pieces of their color on the board, an change the color of some of the pieces already there.
In the end, the player with more pieces wins.

Using Java we implement an engine that suggests a move, given the configuration of the board and the player, within a given time limit.
The engine uses an alpha-beta search algorithm and a compound heuristic, combining a score and a mobility heuristic.
With this heuristic and a time limit of two seconds per move, a naive opponent using the score heuristic and search depth seven can be defeated.

This report is structured into two sections.
In \cref{sec:implementation} the implemented methods and algorithms are explained, as well as the heuristic.
Further, we explain how to install and run the program.
\cref{sec:evaluation} evaluates the different heuristics for both players and different time limits.
